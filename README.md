💰 Financial Analysis Dashboard — SQL 
📌 Project Summary

This project analyzes financial transactions to extract actionable insights using SQL for data analysis.
The goal is not just to “see numbers” — but to understand behavior, detect problems, and support better financial decisions.

🔍 What Was Done

📊 Change Over Time → Monthly trends to detect unstable spending

📈 Cumulative Spend → Running totals to identify long-term patterns

🧩 Segmentation → Category & sub-category breakdown (Income vs Expense)

🍕 Part-to-Whole → Each category’s share of total expenses

🧠 Storytelling — Insight & Intervention
❗ Problem Detected

Analysis showed that monthly spending is dominated by a few categories, e.g.:

🏠 Rent

🛒 Groceries

👗 Clothes

🎞️ Entertainment

Some categories were consuming over 150% of the average expected budget, creating financial pressure and zero savings.

✅ Data-Driven Solution

Using the dashboard:

Categories were classified → essential vs discretionary

Spending percentages were calculated relative to total monthly expenses

Overspending was highlighted automatically

Clear budget guidelines were formed for reduction and control

🎯 Outcome

Visibility → You see where money goes instead of guessing

Control → You decide what to cut based on data

Stability → You build a realistic saving plan
