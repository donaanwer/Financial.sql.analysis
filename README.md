Financial Analysis Dashboard Project
Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of personal financial data, focusing on income and expenses. The goal is to gain insights into spending patterns, identify areas of concern, and support better financial planning.

Using SQL queries, we extracted and aggregated key metrics from financial transactions. The analysis was then visualized in dashboards to create an interactive and actionable view of the data.

Key Features

Change Over Time Analysis

Tracks monthly spending and income trends.

Identifies months with unusually high or low expenses.

Highlights fluctuations to help in budgeting decisions.

Cumulative Analysis

Calculates running totals of expenses over the year.

Helps identify which categories contribute most to overall spending.

Useful for spotting patterns and long-term financial behavior.

Performance Analysis

Compares category-level spending against the overall average.

Highlights categories that are overspending or underspending.

Supports informed decision-making on cutting unnecessary expenses.

Segmentation Analysis

Groups transactions by category, sub-category, and type (Expense/Income).

Allows targeting of specific financial behaviors and trends.

Helps understand which segments dominate spending or contribute most to income.

Part-to-Whole Analysis

Shows each categoryâ€™s contribution to total expenses.

Enables prioritization of key expense areas.

Visualizes how spending is distributed across categories.

Insights & Storytelling

Problem:
Analysis revealed that certain expense categories consume a disproportionate amount of monthly income. For instance:

Groceries and Rent account for ~128% and ~187% of monthly spending relative to average allocations.

Discretionary categories like Clothes and Entertainment also consume a large portion of the budget.

This imbalance creates financial stress and limits opportunities for saving.

Solution:
By leveraging the dashboard and SQL report:

Expenses are classified into essential and discretionary categories.

Percentage of total expenses is calculated for each category to identify major cost drivers.

Monthly performance is monitored to detect unusual spending patterns.

Actionable insights are generated for better budget planning and savings strategies.

Outcome:

Users gain clear visibility into spending habits.

Priorities are set to reduce unnecessary expenses.

Long-term financial stability and smarter planning are enabled.
